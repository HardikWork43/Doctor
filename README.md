🚀 Getting Started
Install Dependencies:

npm install
Start the Application:

npm run dev
This will start both the frontend (Vite) and backend (Express) servers concurrently.

Database Setup:
The system uses SQLite for simplicity. The database will be created automatically when you start the server.

Seed Data:
The system includes seed data with:

Admin user: admin@dentalcare.com / admin123
Doctor users: *.@hospital.com / doctor123
Patient users: *.@example.com / patient123
🔧 Frontend Integration
I've also created:

API utility functions (src/utils/api.js) for all backend endpoints
Authentication context (src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx) for state management
Protected routes and role-based access
📊 Admin Features
Dashboard with statistics
User management
Appointment oversight
Contact form management

👨‍⚕️ Doctor Features
